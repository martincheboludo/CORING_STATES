What is BFN?

BFN is a mod that aims to give players a reasonable mechanic to core their conquests, based on historical, ethnic, linguistic and geographical ties between peoples.

What features does the mod have?
Coring decisions for all Majors and almost all minors. 
Over 100 formables, many of which are unique

How does it work?
Decisions cost between 20 and 100pp, and use up between 5 and 25 civilian factories for 7-35 days, per state. After the wait, the state gets cores. The closer the state in terms of proximity, ethnicity, language, etc the easier it will be to integrate, and viceversa.

Logical cores like coring Canada as the USA, German Switzerland as Germany, Uruguay as Argentina, etc will have no special requirements other than controlling the state in question. More complex cores like coring the entire European Union, will require you to proclaim the formable first to “justify” on which basis you are coring said states.
