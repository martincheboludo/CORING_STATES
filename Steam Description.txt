BFN is a mod designed to give players a realistic and strategic way to core their conquests, in a way which isn't gamebreaking.

Neighboring Core Decision: You can core a state that borders your existing core territory. This decision costs 50 political power (pp), takes 30 days to complete, and requires 10 free civilian factories.

Remote Core Decision: You can also core a remote state that does not border your core territory. This decision costs 150 political power (pp), takes 90 days to complete, and requires 30 free civilian factories.

Wartime Adjustments: If you are at war, the cost and duration for both coring decisions are doubled.

Formable Nations: The mod includes over 100 formable nations, offering new and unique paths for players to explore.

For an epic World War II experience, consider combining Better Peace Deals, Golden Edition, and Better Formable Nations in a single playthrough. Together, these mods offer a rich, immersive blend of enhanced peace deal mechanics, deeper nation-forming options, and intensified strategic realism. Whether you're shaping new empires, negotiating complex peace deals, or tackling tougher enemies, these sister mods provide a truly dynamic and authentic World War II journey in Hearts of Iron IV.
