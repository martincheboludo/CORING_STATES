BFN is a mod designed to give players a realistic and strategic way to core their conquests, in a way which isn't gamebreaking.

Neighboring Core Decision: You can core a state that borders your existing core territory. This decision costs 50 political power (pp), takes 30 days to complete, and requires 10 free civilian factories.

Remote Core Decision: You can also core a remote state that does not border your core territory. This decision costs 150 political power (pp), takes 90 days to complete, and requires 30 free civilian factories.

Wartime Adjustments: If you are at war, the cost and duration for both coring decisions are doubled.

Formable Nations: The mod includes over 100 formable nations, offering new and unique paths for players to explore.
