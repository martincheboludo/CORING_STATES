BFN aims to introduce simple Coring decisions ranging from 20-100pp, 7-35 days and 5-25 Civ Factories, depending on how hard it is to core said state. The closer the geographic location, ethnicities, language and plausible historical claims, the easier to core, on the other hand, the more distance and different the culture, the harder it will be to core.

All Majors and Interesting Minors have been given Coring decisions and Formable Nations.
